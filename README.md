# SMF-28

A project to model and simulate energy distribution in fiber optics cable using
MATLAB and Comsol Multiphysics, and a bit of ruby to prettify the output.

Most of it was based on models available in the Comsol tutorials and is unlikely
to have any real scientific value as it was an undergrad project.

This project was done at Photonics Research Center at the Université du Québec
en Outaouais as a research intern.
